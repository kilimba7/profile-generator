# Team Profile Generator

  ## Description
  I created this application in order to generate team profiles with pertinent information. This allows the user to check for contact information and what role they hold on their team. One of the challenges I faced was getting my information to display, and all my tests to successfully run. Iâ€™m also still trying to find the best way to loop through my data, so that my page-template loads up better.
